This project was a way to learn how the Gatsby ecosystem works. I followed the code examples to try and import data from a 3rd party API, then installed MUI so I could add an interface to parse and show the data. I have done this same project with Create React App before, and once before that with NokoGiri to generate the JSON as in previous years TIFF did not have a public JSON API.
